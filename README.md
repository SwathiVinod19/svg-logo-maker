Next, clone this project repository to your local machine. 
Use the command "npm install" in the terminal to install dependencies. 
Use the command "npm install --save-dev jest" to install Jest as a devDependency.

 Contact me for any contribution ideas or requests.

## Tests
Each shape class (Circle, Square, and Triangle) is tested for a render() method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file matching color and text requests. 
Type "npm test" or “npm run test” or “npx jest shapes.test.js” in the command line and Jest will run all three tests.
